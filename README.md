# ProjectManagementApp

Hello :) 

I started this project during EPAM University Program at .NET Development Training as a final project of training (development scope 2 weeks - at the time on GitLab).

Below is my coding history of preperation to training and selecting process (3 weeks of solving challenges) and the whole .NET training (6-7 months of learning, coding and solving various of tasks).

For the training purpose it supposed to be a simple To Do List app that could allow to become familiar with the ASP.NET Core MVC:

My Kanban (management) approach during (basic version) app development -> https://trello.com/b/IlCUwPL4/to-do-list-project

Because of my interesting and education in Project Management (Agile approach) I decided to extend the basic project and develop something similar to monday.com:

I'm not a frontend developer but we will see what I can achieve ;)

For management purpose I use Jira, to keep on track, be more familiare with Jira features and practice project management.
