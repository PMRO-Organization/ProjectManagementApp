# ProjectManagementApp

Hello :) 

I started this project during EPAM University Program at .NET Development Training as a final project of training (at the time on GitLab).

For training purpose it supposed to be a simple ToDo List app - and it was, but because of my interesting and education in Project Management (Agile approach) I decided to extend the basic project and develop something similar to monday.com. I'm not a front-end developer, I'm focused on backend but we will see what I can achieve ;)
