# ProjectManagementApp

Hello :) 

I started this project during EPAM University Program at .NET Development Training as a final project of training (development scope 2 weeks - at the time on GitLab).

Below is my coding history of preperation to training and selecting process (3 weeks of solving challenges) and the whole .NET training (6-7 months of learning, coding and solving various of tasks).

Timeline Updates:

... - 31.05.2023 | Project development and commits history slowed down because of preparation to Summer Internship opportunities.

31.05.2023 - presently | It's tough to get on first job, I gained some experience during summer internship's interviews and challenges, but decided to get some work for money during summer that allow me learn further. At the same time during summer work I'm going to implement new features and improve my portfolio's projects ;)

For the training purpose it supposed to be a simple To Do List app that allowed to become familiar with the ASP.NET Core MVC:

My Kanban (management) approach during (basic version) app development -> https://trello.com/b/IlCUwPL4/to-do-list-project

Because of my interesting and education in Project Management (Agile approach) I decided to extend the basic project and develop something similar to monday.com:

I'm not a frontend developer but we will see what I can achieve ;)

I designed a few visualizations of app (by using GIMP).

For management purpose I use Jira, to keep on track, be more familiare with Jira features and practice project management.
