# ProjectManagementApp

Hello :) 

I started this project during EPAM University Program at .NET Development Training as a final project of training (development scope 2 weeks - at the time on GitLab).

Below is my coding history from the preperation and selecting participants weeks (3 weeks of solving some challenges) and the whole .NET training (6-7 months of learning, coding and solving various of tasks).

For the training purpose it supposed to be a simple ToDo List app - and it was:

but because of my interesting and education in Project Management (Agile approach) I decided to extend the basic project and develop something similar to monday.com.

I'm not a front-end developer, I'm focused on backend but we will see what I can achieve ;)
